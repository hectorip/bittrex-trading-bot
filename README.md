## Cryptocurrency Trading Bot with Go

I made this for an [article I wrote over at GoPHP.io](https://gophp.io/how-to-make-a-cryptocurrency-trading-bot-with-golang). All the code is MIT Licensed which makes it free to take, modify and use.

If this code has helped you and want to buy me some coffee, feel free to send some crypto to one of my [wallets](https://ma.rkus.io/wallets)
